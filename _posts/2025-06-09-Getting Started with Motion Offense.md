When introducing motion offense, start simple and build gradually. Focus on foundational movements before layering complexity. Use this sequence to guide your teaching.

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 1 â€” Visual & Repetition

Start by showing players a simple triangle to teach spacing and movement (ideal for beginners).

Then progress to passâ€“cutâ€“replace, starting corner to corner, then adding randomness.

{% include teaching-point-by-id.html id="TP-018" description="5 out - pass/cut/replace (random)" %}

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 2 â€” Add Defense

Introduce defenders to challenge player decision-making.  
{% include teaching-point-by-id.html id="TP-030" description="5 out - pass/cut/replace (with defence)" %}

Add two constraints:
- Limit to 3 dribbles per touch.
- Only catch passes outside the three or inside the key.

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 3 â€” Dynamic Reads

Now, layer in reads that help players react to defenders while staying in the motion structure.

When a defender steps up with one foot over the three-point line, the ball-handler should immediately cut â€” a *read the line* cue.  
{% include teaching-point-by-id.html id="TP-019" description="Readline cut" %}

If two defenders collapse into the paint, teach the *opposite 45 cut* â€” which creates space by pulling help defense away.  
{% include teaching-point-by-id.html id="TP-010" description="45 cut " %}

Other reads like *drive â†’ kick out â†’ relocate â†’ shot*, *back cuts from the corner*, and *base cuts from the high post* against zones should be layered in gradually as game-like options.
